1- PLaces content require a vertical scroll bar when the Home panel is resized to a bigger i.e. taller size. The same for the new Schedule panel.
They already have a scroll bar. If the content is big enough i.e: multiple places, it will show a scrollbar to scroll. Scrollbar would still be shown if you resize the homepanel
